# Project Notes

## IDE Plugin Validator Warnings

The VSCode extension's plugin validator may show warnings for valid attributes (e.g., `allowed-tools` in skill files).
Before acting on such warnings, verify against the actual plugin spec or other skill files in this repo.
Do not remove or change attributes solely based on IDE warnings without confirming they are genuinely invalid.
